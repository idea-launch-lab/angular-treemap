# angular-treemap

angular-treemap is an angular directive for a D3 treemap. jQuery, D3, and obviously AngularJS is required.

## History

angular-treemap is a port of Mike Bostock's 'Zoomable Treemap' (http://bost.ocks.org/mike/treemap/). The changes are:

* Ported to coffeescript
* Refactored
* Ported into an AngularJS directive
* Added color support
* Added additional attributes for color, click handling, and naming.

## Getting Started

* Download the code
* It's a Yeoman project, so you can run it by doing 'grunt server'.
* To install in your app copy angular-treemap.js.coffee and angular-treemap.scss into your application.
* Add 'angular-treemap' as a dependency to your controller.
* Look at index.html for an example of how to use the directive.
* Look at flare_with_color.json for the data format.
